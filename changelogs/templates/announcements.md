- Automated API Documentation Updates recently implemented
- At long last, a new Lidarr `develop` / beta release
- ** Known Issues **
  - Linux users map experience errors such as:
    - `You have an old version of fpcalc. Please upgrade to 1.4.3.`
    - `An error occurred trying to start process '/opt/Lidarr/fpcalc' with working directory '/'. Permission denied`
  - A fix will be out soon, but this can be fixed by setting fpcalc to be executable `chmod +x /opt/Lidarr/fpcalc`
  - Note that for the fix `sudo` may be required or your path to Lidarr's binary folder may be different depending on your environment and setup.
